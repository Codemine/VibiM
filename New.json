Since you are on mobile, here are the direct links to every page you need to visit to set up the credentials for your project.

1. Database (MongoDB Atlas)

This is where you will store the donated Gemini keys and the user chat histories.

Link: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register

What to do: Create a "Shared" (Free) cluster. Once created, click "Connect" -> "Drivers" to get your MONGODB_URI.

2. Google Login (Google Cloud Console)

This allows users to log in with their Google accounts so you can identify them and save their history.

Link: https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

What to do:

Create a "New Project."

Click "Create Credentials" -> "OAuth Client ID."

Select "Web Application."

Crucial: Add https://your-domain.vercel.app/auth/google/callback to the Authorized redirect URIs.

3. GitHub Connection (GitHub Developer Settings)

This allows users to "Connect to GitHub" and select their repositories.

Link: https://github.com/settings/developers

What to do:

Click "OAuth Apps" -> "New OAuth App."

Homepage URL: https://your-domain.vercel.app.

Authorization callback URL: https://your-domain.vercel.app/auth/github/callback.

Copy the Client ID and click "Generate a new client secret."

4. Your First Gemini Key (Google AI Studio)

This is the MASTER_KEY so your website works even before anyone else donates a key.

Link: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey

What to do: Click "Create API key" and copy the string starting with AIza.

5. Deployment & Secret Storage (Vercel)

This is where you host your website for free and safely input your .env variables so they are never exposed on GitHub.

Link: https://vercel.com/new

What to do:

Import your GitHub repository.

Before clicking "Deploy," open the Environment Variables section.

Add your MONGODB_URI, GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID, GITHUB_CLIENT_ID, etc., here.

6. Managing the Code (GitHub Web UI)

Use this to create your files and the .gitignore so your secrets don't leak.

Link: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VibiM (Replace with your username).

What to do: Click "Add file" -> "Create new file" to add the server.js, public/index.html, etc.

Quick Checklist for your mobile browser tabs:

Tab 1: MongoDB (Copy connection string).

Tab 2: Google Cloud (Copy ID and Secret).

Tab 3: GitHub Settings (Copy ID and Secret).

Tab 4: Google AI Studio (Copy Gemini Key).

Tab 5: Vercel (Paste all of the above into the Settings).

Pro Tip: Use the Notes app on your phone to collect all these keys in one place before you start pasting them into Vercel. Once you're done, delete that note!
